# TimeOfDayMessage
Here is a link to view the website: https://jordangregson.github.io/TimeOfDayMessage/
I didn't know what else to name this program. I just started to learn Javascript, and this program is me using the Date and hour to provide the user with a message. I will also be attempting to apply CSS to this program.

This has now become a place where I test new concepts that I learn about Javascript. It has become more than just a time of day message.
